# Notes for 08-26-2013

* Constants at the top of the file are gravy
* Only use enumerated typed if you need to
* Use subroutines (functions) to save time
	* DRY!
* You don't have to use makefiles
* Debugging is your friend (cout is helpful)
	* I like Valgrind
* Try not to write spaghetti code
* KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
* Use the simplist data types possible
* GoTo's are bad, but loops have GoTo's. Are loops bad?
	* No, because it is hidden.
* Try not to use pointers
